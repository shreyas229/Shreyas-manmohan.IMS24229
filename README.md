## 📘 Overview
This assignment implements **recursive spectral modularity partitioning** to detect communities in the **Zachary’s Karate Club Graph**, a classic dataset in network science.

The project explores how **mathematical concepts from graph theory** translate into algorithms for community detection and how **node centrality metrics** evolve as the network splits into distinct communities.

---

## 🧩 Tasks Implemented
1. **Recursive Spectral Modularity Partitioning**  
   - Performed spectral bisection using the modularity matrix  
   - Continued splitting recursively to detect multiple communities  

2. **Visualization After Each Split**  
   - Colored nodes according to community membership  
   - Displayed iteration-wise network evolution  

3. **Node Centrality Metrics**  
   - Computed **Degree**, **Betweenness**, **Closeness**, and **Clustering Coefficient**  
   - Tracked metric changes after each recursive partition  

4. **Analysis and Discussion**  
   - Identified key central nodes that retain importance across iterations  
   - Discussed how community structure influences local and global network properties
